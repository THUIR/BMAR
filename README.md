INSTALLATION
============

* Just get to the directory of the codes and run the function with its name, the "opts" can be omitted.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

The toolbox has been tested in Matlab 2012b (64-bit and 32-bit) under three major OS: Windows 7/8 (64-bit and 32-bit), Linux (Red-Hat Enterprise Linux) (64-bit and 32-bit) and Mac OS X. The toolbox is also compatable for Octave (version 3.8.0) in the Pseudo GUI (PGUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) under three major OS: Windows 7, Linux (64-bit and 32-bit), and Mac OS X.
